## III. Detail of work

1. Generate Data
    - Generate rawdata and copy to workfolder
2. Design data pipeline ![data_pipeline](./docs/data_pipeline.png)
3. Design finance database ![finance_database](./docs/finance_database.png)
4. Design the dimensional model schema ![Finance_DW](./docs/Finance_DW.png)
    - Defined Dimensiona tables and Facts tables
    - Design logical data map: [here]()
5. Ingest data from flat file csv
    -  Design SSIS package to ETL the data
    -  Using SSIS pipe line load data to SQL Server (Fiance Database)
    -  Using SSIS stage data in SQL Server (stage)
6. Load data onto Snowflake
    -  Using SSIS load dimDate to Snowflake (1 times)
    -  Using SSIS load data from SQL Server (stage) to Snowflake
7. Visualize data using PowerBI
   - Connect Snowflake source
   - Visualize data
   -  Connect Power BI Desktop with Power BI Service
